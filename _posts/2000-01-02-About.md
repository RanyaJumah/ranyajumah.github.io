I am a PhD student at the [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/) at Imperial College London advised by Dr. [Hamed Haddadi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.haddadi) and Dr. [David Boyle](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.boyle). My research interests include: Internet of Things (IoT), Data Security & Privacy, Privacy Preserving Technologies (PPTs), Edge AI, Audio Signal Processing, and their intersection. In particular, I am interested in designing and building more effective, secure solutions that enable better use of our digital footprint, while respecting users' privacy.

To protect privacy, it is necessary to understand: (1) what/where information might leak, (2) the constraints of designing protection systems e.g., computational resources and latency requirements, and (3) how to deploy it without compromising the security of these systems. Thus, my contributions can be summarized under three main themes which are:
- Privacy-preserving Representation Learning. 
- Privacy-aware Machine Learning for Voice Analytics.
- Trustworthiness and Privacy Preservation.



I am always curious to learn more about what new in machine learning techniques and its potential applications to data security and privacy. I also LOVE the hacking world and in my spare time I do ethical hacking using the [Kali](https://www.kali.org/)!
